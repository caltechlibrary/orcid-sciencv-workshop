#  Benefits of using your ORCID iD

20 Minutes

## Learning Objectives

* Integrate your ORCID account with a third party service
 
As ORCID gains status as a global standard identifier for authors, an increasing number of research services integrate with ORCID.  Examples or services that harvest ORCID data and display publication metrics include:

* [ImpactStory](https://profiles.impactstory.org/), a researcher profile system that includes alternative metrics for your research contributions (twitter account required for registation)
* [ScienceOpen](https://www.scienceopen.com/), a researcher profile and open access publishing platform that offers lay summaries of papers, alternative metrics, and more
* [GrowKudos](https://www.growkudos.com/), a research profile system that offers lay summaries of papers, alternative metrics
* [OpenVivo](http://openvivo.org/), a demonstration version of the VIVO profile system that supports contributor roles taxonomy and author networks. The small size and experimental nature of its dataset, however, limit functionality. It offers more of a demontration site than a fully-functional author dashboard. 
* [MySciEnCV](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sciencv/), the researcher profile system shared by United States funders
 
### Exercise

Let's create a NIH or NSF biosketch in SciENcv. If you don't already have a NIH
account, you can avoid creating a separate login by clicking the 3rd party sign 
in option on the login screen and picking ORCID. Go to [MySciEnCV](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sciencv/)
and, click the blue "Click Here to Start" button, and look for the 3rd party
sign in link

Search for ORCID, and login. Sometimes you get rediercted to the main NIH
account page, sciENcv is in the bottom left. Click Create New Biosketch, give
it a name, pick a format, and select ORCID as the data source.

Youâ€™ll be able to add works from your ORCID record to the biosketch with just one click.
