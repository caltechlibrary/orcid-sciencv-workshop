<h1>Adding Works to your ORCID profile</h1>

<p>30 Minutes</p>

<hr>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<ul>
<li>Enter research contributions to the &lsquo;Works&rsquo; section of your ORCID profile using three different methods</li>
<li>Compare displayed citations added by these different methods</li>
<li>Practice editing a record, once added from a preferred source</li>
<li>Manage duplicate records</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Exercise 1. Add a work to your ORCID Profile using its Digital Object Identifier (DOI)</h2>

<p>In the &lsquo;Works&rsquo; section of your ORCID profile, click on the Tab &lsquo;+ Add Works&rsquo; and select the option &lsquo;Add DOI&rsquo;, as illustrated below:</p>

<p><img src="img/orcid11-add_doi.jpg" alt="___Figure 1a. Work added using DOI___" /></p>

<p>A dialog box will display for &lsquo;ADD WORK&rsquo;, as illustrated below. In the blank text box,
enter the DOI for the work you wish to add. The illustration below shows how to add a paper
with the DOI <code>10.1016/j.cbpa.2009.04.470</code> but you are encouraged to add a DOI for your own work instead!</p>

<p><img src="img/orcid3_500.jpg" alt="___Figure 1b. Work added using DOI___" /></p>

<hr>

<p>Click on the blue button &lsquo;Retrieve work details&rsquo; and a metadata form will display with details
populated from the DOI record. Leave the form as is; scroll to the bottom to set the privacy to
&lsquo;Trusted&rsquo;, and click &lsquo;Add to list&rsquo;.</p>

<p><img src="img/orcid4_500.jpg" alt="___Figure 1c. Confirm added work___" /></p>

<hr>

<p>Back in your ORCID profile, refresh the &lsquo;Works&rsquo; section by clicking on the &lsquo;Sort&rsquo; button and
select &lsquo;Sort by Title&rsquo;. Now look on the screen to view the work you just added.</p>

<p>Note that at the bottom of this record in your ORCID &lsquo;Works&rsquo; list, the &lsquo;Source:&rsquo; is credited to your name. Because this record was added by you, you may edit this record to your heart&rsquo;s content.  In the bottom right corner of the record, click on the pencil icon to open up the record for editing. When the metadata template opens up, you may change a field or add data to an empty field.</p>

<p>For this record, add a few words to the &lsquo;Description&rsquo; field (for example, type &ldquo;This is my paper&rdquo; ). Save and close the record.</p>

<p>You have complete control over what shows up in your ORCID record. You can
delete the entry by clicking the trach icon.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Exercise 2. Add a work to your ORCID Profile using the &lsquo;Search &amp; link&rsquo; tool</h2>

<p>In the &lsquo;Works&rsquo; section of the ORCID profile, click on the Tab &lsquo;+ Add Works&rsquo;. Select the option &lsquo;Search &amp; link; a long list of searchable databases will display, as the illustration below shows.</p>

<p><img src="img/orcid11-searchlink.jpg" alt="___Figure 2a. Work added using Search &amp; link___" /></p>

<p>Scroll to the link for &ldquo;CrossRef Metadata Search&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The link takes you to the database for the CrossRef DOI Registration agency, while you are still logged into
your ORCID account (see your name and the ORCID logo in the top right corner of the screen). Most publishers
use CrossRef to register DOIs for their articles, book chapters, and proceedings.</p>

<p>In the search box at the top of the screen, enter the title for a work you wish
to add to your ORCID (searching by name usually doesn&rsquo;t work that well). If you
need something to search for, try the title &ldquo;How many extant pinniped species remain to be described?&rdquo;, as illustrated below.</p>

<p><img src="img/orcid6_700.jpg" alt="___Figure 2b. Search for Crossref record___" /></p>

<p>Note that in the bottom right corner of the CrossRef record appears a little ORCID logo next to
&lsquo;ADD TO ORCID&rsquo;. Click this link to copy the record into your ORCID profile. You will be prompted to
confirm that you wish to add this record to ORCID; click &lsquo;YES&rsquo;.</p>

<p><img src="img/orcid7_500.jpg" alt="___Figure 2c. Add Crossref record___" /></p>

<p>Refresh your ORCID profile again, sort your &lsquo;Works&rsquo; by title, and find the record you just
added from &lsquo;Search &amp; link&rsquo;.  Note that at the bottom of this record the &lsquo;Source&rsquo; is displayed
as &lsquo;CrossRef Metadata Search&rsquo;. Also note that you are not provided the pencil icon to edit this
record. Instead, the icon in the bottom right corner is a &lsquo;fork&rsquo; symbol &ndash; meaning you can make a copy of the record and edit the copy.</p>

<p><img src="img/orcid11-Source_500.jpg" alt="___Figure 2d. View Crossref record___" /></p>

<p>The CrossRef record is locked from editing because it is an authoritative data source.
The records it supplies via &lsquo;Search &amp; link&rsquo; are authoritative, and the integration between ORCID and CrossRef
is based on a trusted set of principles and business rules. Having &lsquo;trusted&rsquo; data providers working with ORCID makes this system accurate and reliable!</p>

<h2>Exercise 3. Synch your ORCID with CrossRef</h2>

<p>Now we can authorize CrossRef to automatically update your ORCID profile to
automatically update whenever you publish a new work that has a CrossRef DOI!<br>
And the publication metadata added to your ORCID will be accurate and authoritative.</p>

<h3>ORCID-CrossRef Synch Step 1.</h3>

<p>Look for the ORCID icon and your name in the top right corner of the CrossRef screen, as shown below. Click on your name to display the drop-down menu.</p>

<p><img src="img/crossref-synch_600.jpg" alt="___Figure 3a. Step 1 of ORCID-Crossref-Synch___" /></p>

<h3>ORCID-CrossRef Synch Step 2.</h3>

<p>Select &lsquo;Settings&rsquo;</p>

<p><img src="img/crossref-synch2.jpg" alt="___Figure 3b. Step 2 of ORCID-Crossref-Synch___" /></p>

<h3>ORCID-CrossRef Synch Step 3.</h3>

<p>Confirm you wish to synch by clicking the orange &lsquo;Sync with ORCID&rsquo; button.</p>

<p><img src="img/crossref-synch3_700.jpg" alt="___Figure 3c. Step 3 of ORCID-Crossref-Synch___" /></p>

<h3>ORCID-CrossRef Synch Step 4.</h3>

<p>Return to your ORCID profile and click on &lsquo;Account Settings&rsquo; at near the top of the
screen. You will now see that have authorized CrossRef to update your ORCID profile
as your new publications are released. You may revoke this permission anytime by
clicking the delete button displayed on the right side of the CrossRef permission.</p>

<h2>Exercise 4. Add a work to your ORCID Profile by uploading a BibTeX file</h2>

<p>There is no universal coding format for scholarly citations: some systems use XML, others use JSON,
and yet others use LaTeX and its bibliography syntax known as BibTeX. The ORCID system accepts BibTeX.</p>

<p>Caltech Library maintains publication records in our institutional repository for Caltech researchers.
You can download a BibTex file of your publications by selecting your name at <a href="https://feeds.library.caltech.edu/people/">https://feeds.library.caltech.edu/people/</a>
, going to the CaltechAUTHORS section, picking the type of content you want to add, and clicking BibTex.</p>

<p>In the &lsquo;Works&rsquo; section of your record, click on &lsquo;Add works&rsquo; select the option to upload a BibTeX file, as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="img/orcid11-bibtex.jpg" alt="___Figure 4a. Add BibTeX___" /></p>

<p>An upload prompt will display, so browse to your desktop and select the BibTeX
file you downloaded&rsquo;.</p>

<p><img src="img/orcid15_700.png" alt="___Figure 4b. Select BibTeX file___" /></p>

<p>Save the uploaded file by clicking on the little green icon that looks like either an old-fashioned computer disk or a hotel bed.</p>

<p><img src="img/orcid16.png" alt="___Figure 4c. Review BibTeX___" /></p>

<p>You can also get BibTeX files from reference managers like Zotero and publisher
web sites.</p>

<h2>Exercise 5</h2>

<p>Delete any works you added for testing that arn&rsquo;t yours by using the delete
trash can icon.</p>

<h2>Exercise 6</h2>
