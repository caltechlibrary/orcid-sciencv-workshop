#  Adding Works to your ORCID profile

60 Minutes

---

## Learning Objectives

* Enter research contributions to the 'Works' section of your ORCID profile using three different methods
* Compare displayed citations added by these different methods
* Practice editing a record, once added from a preferred source
* Manage duplicate records

---

## Exercise 1. Add a work to your ORCID Profile using its Digital Object Identifier (DOI)

In the 'Works' section of your ORCID profile, click on the Tab '+ Add Works' and select the option 'Add DOI', as illustrated below:

![___Figure 1a. Work added using DOI___](img/orcid11-add_doi.jpg)

A dialog box will display for 'ADD WORK', as illustrated below. In the blank text box, enter the DOI for the work you wish to add. The illustration below shows how to add a paper from Hugh Shanahan's ORCID profile, using the DOI `10.1016/j.cbpa.2009.04.470` but you are encouraged to add a DOI for your own work instead!

![___Figure 1b. Work added using DOI___](img/orcid3_500.jpg)

-----

Click on the blue button 'Retrieve work details' and a metadata form will display with details populated from the DOI record. Leave the form as is; scroll to the bottom to set the privacy to 'Trusted', and click 'Add to list'.

-----

Back in your ORCID profile, refresh the 'Works' section by clicking on the 'Sort' button and select 'Sort by Title'. Now look on the screen to view the work you just added. The illustration below shows the displayed version of Hugh Shanahan's work associated with `10.1016/j.cbpa.2009.04.470`.  

![___Figure 1d. View added work___](img/orcid5_500.jpg)

Note that at the bottom of this record in your ORCID 'Works' list, the 'Source:' is credited to your name. Because this record was added by you, you may edit this record to your heart's content.  In the bottom right corner of the record, click on the pencil icon to open up the record for editing. When the metadata template opens up, you may change a field or add data to an empty field. 

For this record, add a few words to the 'Description' field (for example, type "This is my paper" or "I borrowed this paper from Hugh for testing purposes"). Save and close the record.


-------------------------

## Exercise 2. Add a work to your ORCID Profile using the 'Search & link' tool

In the 'Works' section of the ORCID profile, click on the Tab '+ Add Works'. Select the option 'Search & link; a long list of searchable databases will display, as the illustration below shows.

![___Figure 2a. Work added using Search & link___](img/orcid11-searchlink.jpg)

Scroll to the link for "CrossRef Metadata Search".

The link takes you to the database for the CrossRef DOI Registration agency, while you are still logged into your ORCID account (see your name and the ORCID logo in the top right corner of the screen). Most publishers use CrossRef to register DOIs for their articles, book chapters, and proceedings.

In the search box at the top of the screen, enter the title for a work you wish to add to your ORCID. If you are following along using Hugh Shanahan's work as a test, enter the title for his journal article "How many extant pinniped species remain to be described?", as illustrated below.

![___Figure 2b. Search for Crossref record___](img/orcid6_700.jpg)

Note that in the bottom right corner of the CrossRef record appears a little ORCID logo next to 'ADD TO ORCID'. Click this link to copy the record into your ORCID profile. You will be prompted to confirm that you wish to add this record to ORCID; click 'YES'.


![___Figure 2c. Add Crossref record___](img/orcid7_500.jpg)

Refresh your ORCID profile again, sort your 'Works' by title, and find the record you just added from 'Search & link'.  Note that at the bottom of this record the 'Source' is displayed as 'CrossRef Metadata Search'. Also note that you are not provided the pencil icon to edit this record. Instead, the icon in the bottom right corner is a 'fork' symbol -- meaning you can make a copy of the record and edit the copy. 

![___Figure 2d. View Crossref record___](img/orcid11-Source_500.jpg)

The CrossRef record is locked from editing because it is an authoritative data source. The records it supplies via 'Search & link' are guaranteed for accuracy, and the integration between ORCID and CrossRef is based on a trusted set of principles and business rules. Having 'trusted' data providers working with ORCID makes this system accurate and reliable!  

-----

## Exercise 3. Synch your ORCID with CrossRef 

The trusted integration between CrossRef and ORCID has another benefit: it allows your ORCID profile to automatically update whenever you publish a new work that has a CrossRef DOI!  And the publication metadata added to your ORCID will be accurate and authoritative.

### ORCID-CrossRef Synch Step 1.
To perform the synch step, return to CrossRef while you are still logged into your ORCID profile. Look for the ORCID icon and your name in the top right corner of the CrossRef screen, as shown below. Click on your name to display the drop-down menu.


![___Figure 3a. Step 1 of ORCID-Crossref-Synch___](img/crossref-synch_600.jpg)

### ORCID-CrossRef Synch Step 2.

Select 'Settings'

![___Figure 3b. Step 2 of ORCID-Crossref-Synch___](img/crossref-synch2.jpg)

### ORCID-CrossRef Synch Step 3.

Confirm you wish to synch by clicking the orange 'Sync with ORCID' button.

![___Figure 3c. Step 3 of ORCID-Crossref-Synch___](img/crossref-synch3_700.jpg)

### ORCID-CrossRef Synch Step 4.

Return to your ORCID profile and click on 'Account Settings' at near the top of the screen. You will now see that have authorized CrossRef to update your ORCID profile as your new publications are released. You may revoke this permission anytime by clicking the delete button displayed on the right side of the CrossRef permission.

## Exercise 4. Add a work to your ORCID Profile by uploading a BibTeX file

There is no universal coding format for scholarly citations: some systems use XML, others use JSON, and yet others use LaTeX and its bibliography syntax known as BibTeX. The ORCID system accepts BibTeX.

To get the BibTeX citation depends on the platform that provides the citation. Many publisher sites offer the option of downloading the citation in BibTeX. For this exercise, we will capture the BibTeX 
for one of Hugh Shanahan's conference abstracts and upload it to ORCID as a test.

### BibTeX Step 1.

Point your web browser to [Hugh's publications page](http://www.shanahanlab.org/?COLLCC=1022692939&) at http://www.shanahanlab.org/?COLLCC=1022692939&. Under '2019', click on his submitted paper '9 Simple recommendations for teaching data skills'. This sounds like a very interesting paper, right?!

### BibTeX Step 2. 

Click on the Tab 'Cite this' and scroll down the page until you see the option for 'BibTeX. Starting with the `@` at the beginning of the code and continuing down to the ending `}`, copy all of this code. Make sure to catch to `@` and the `}` on either end.

### BibTeX Step 3. 

Open a plain text file in Notepad, Wordpad, or another editor of your chouce and paste in the BibTeX code. Make sure there is no space or character before the leading `@` and the after the ending `}`. Save the plain text file as 'Hugh.bib'

### BibTeX Step 4. 

Back in your ORCID profile in the 'Works' section, click on 'Add works' select the option to upload a BibTeX file, as shown below.

![___Figure 4a. Add BibTeX___](img/orcid11-bibtex.jpg)

An upload prompt will display, so browse to your desktop and select the file 'Hugh.bib'

![___Figure 4b. Select BibTeX file___](img/orcid15_700.png)

Save the uploaded file by clicking on the little green icon that looks like either an old-fashioned computer disk or a hotel bed.

![___Figure 4c. Review BibTeX___](img/orcid16.png)

Hugh's abstract is now added to your ORCID profile as a test!

## Exercise 5 (Mandatory!)

Delete any works you added from Hugh's publication list because they were just for testing, and we understand the importance of giving credit where due!
